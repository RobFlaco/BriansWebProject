                <h3>Music Player</h3>
                <p>This is one of my first projects in web development. It is a fully functional music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    It features three albums, each in various lengths, with the ability to play, pause, skip forward, and skip backward. It also features 
                    an interactive progress bar that updates as the song plays, backround color that updates based on the album, and a responsive design 
                    that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

                <h3>GROWTH</h3>
                <p>This album was written as I grew to realize that a life of 
                    drugs and alcohol was the reason for my struggles, not the solution. I got sober
                    and began the process of getting my life together during this time.

                <h3>Youth</h3>
                <p>This album was written in my youth, as I lived a life of 
                    partying and hooliganism. I am not proud of the choices 
                    I made during this time, but I am also not ashamed, as 
                    every choice Ive made has led me to who I am today.

                <h3>Lifes Been Great</h3>
                <p>This album was a collaboration between me and my friend/producer
                    JDS, who is a lifetime musician who has been singing and
                    playing guitar since he was a child. Every track was produced
                    and mixed by JDS.
